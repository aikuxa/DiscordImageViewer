# DiscordImageViewer
Simple Random Image Viewer for a Discord Channel, Useful for Gesture Drawing. This is a very quick and dirty application, meant to be something like https://quickposes.com/en/gestures/timed but with my own images. All you should have to do is plug your own Bot Token and Channel ID in to the appsettings.json.

The code is likely trash, I don't care it's just for myself and anyone else who finds a niche use for this.
